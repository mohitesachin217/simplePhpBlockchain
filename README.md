simple php blockchain.

Welcome to this simple PHP blockchain demo! Designed with clarity and ease of understanding in mind, this project is perfect for students and beginners looking to get a hands-on introduction to the concepts of blockchain technology.

In its current form, the demo includes the fundamental components of a blockchain, such as creating blocks and linking them through hashing. While it’s kept minimalistic, you’re encouraged to expand upon it by adding timestamps, transaction details, or any other fields that suit your educational needs.

Dive into the code, experiment with features, and enjoy your journey through the basics of blockchain!

It is just a demo. I have made it as simple as possible. You can add timestamp and other fields as per the requirements. 
It is just college level project.

Thanks.
